<h2> Swami Vivekananda, born Narendra Nath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Calcutta, India, was a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. His life story is one of profound inspiration, dedication to spiritual ideals, and a relentless pursuit of truth.
From a young age, Narendra showed a keen interest in spirituality and a deep concern for the suffering of humanity. He met his guru, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, at the young age of 18. Under Ramakrishna's guidance, Narendra underwent intense spiritual training, grappling with doubts and questions about the nature of existence and the purpose of life. Through this period of apprenticeship, he transformed into Swami Vivekananda, a name that would resonate across continents.
